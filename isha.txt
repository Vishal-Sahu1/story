The error message you're encountering indicates that the Git command-line tool is not recognized on your system. This typically happens because Git is not installed, or the system's PATH environment variable is not configured correctly to include Git's executable.

Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

1. Install Git
If Git is not installed on your system, you need to download and install it.

For Windows:
Go to the Git for Windows website.
Download the installer.
Run the installer and follow the prompts. Make sure to select the option to add Git to your PATH environment variable during the installation process.
2. Verify Installation
After installation, you need to verify that Git is installed and properly added to your PATH.

Open a new Command Prompt (cmd) or PowerShell window and run the following command:
sh
Copy code
git --version
This should display the installed version of Git. If it doesn't, Git might not have been added to your PATH correctly.
3. Add Git to the PATH (if necessary)
If Git is installed but not recognized, you may need to manually add it to your PATH environment variable.

For Windows:
Press Win + X and select "System" from the menu.
Click on "Advanced system settings".
In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
In the Environment Variables window, find the "Path" variable in the "System variables" section and select it, then click "Edit".
Click "New" and add the path to the Git bin directory (e.g., C:\Program Files\Git\bin).
Click "OK" to close all dialog boxes.
4. Restart PowerShell
After adding Git to your PATH, close and reopen PowerShell to ensure the changes take effect.

5. Initialize Git Repository
Now you can try initializing your Git repository again:

sh
Copy code
git init
This should work without errors if Git is correctly installed and configured on your system.
